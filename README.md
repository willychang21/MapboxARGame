* Abstract
  * With the popularity of Pokemon go, Augmented Reality (AR) technology has become a big hit, and this app is based on Location-Based Service (LBS) combined with AR. The app provides users with the location of each building on the university campus and a route guide so that users can quickly understand the direction of their desired destination. The integration of AR into the User Interface allows the content to be displayed on the mobile device screen in a more intuitive way, thus avoiding the inconvenience of having to cross-reference the map one by one to use the traditional map navigation, and simplifying the operation for the user. The development platform uses Unity and combines with Mapbox-unity-SDK to support Android and iOS systems.
* Introduction
  * Preface
    * Technology is advancing rapidly, and maps have been used from the early days of traditional paper: traditional navigation methods are presented in the form of pictures and text with maps, so whenever users are not familiar with the use of maps, then the function of the guide will be greatly reduced, and may even cause a certain degree of misunderstanding, which may lead to getting lost and other results that defeat the original purpose of the map design. In fact, the most pressing need of users is to know where they are and the direction of their destination, which are problems that traditional map guides cannot overcome. Today, due to the popularization of smart devices, there are many useful apps, such as Google Maps and Apple Map, and we hope to add some interactivity and fun to the APP in addition to navigation.

    * Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that calculates the position and angle of a camera image in real time and adds the corresponding image. In 1997, R. Azuma of the University of North Carolina proposed that augmented reality should include three aspects: integration of virtual objects with reality, real-time, and three-dimensional (Azuma, 1997). Since augmented reality can directly add information to images in real-time, it is often used in navigation and even entertainment. In this study, the augmented reality tour system is used as an example to provide users on various smart mobile devices to download the tour of Fu Jen Catholic University campus through the Internet, so that visitors to Fu Jen Catholic University can get the latest and most real-time tour information.

  * Motivation and Purpose
    * For freshmen entering Fu Jen Catholic University or visitors to Fu Jen Catholic University, whenever they enter the huge Fu Jen campus and don't know where to go, they can only look through the campus map near the entrance of Fu Jen Catholic University, but they can't always find their destination.


    * We hope to combine augmented reality with some interesting games and the history of each building on campus so that users will not only be bored during the touring process but also get to know more about Fu Jen Catholic University through the campus introduction.
    * After many discussions and evaluations, we decided to keep the game as simple as possible, so that it would not interfere with the navigation and introduction.
    
  * Features Introduction
    * If you just want to do the traditional route navigation, you can click on the Bottom of the map in the bottom right corner, but if you want to experience the AR tour with the student introduction, you can click on the destination selection list in the bottom left corner. You can unlock the building when you have enough objects in your backpack. After unlocking the building, you can get information about its history of the building. The restaurant, library, and special attractions all have corresponding functions, so users can go to these places to get the objects they lack, and after unlocking all the buildings, they can graduate from their studies!

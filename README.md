## Abstract

The popularity of Pokemon Go has spotlighted Augmented Reality (AR) technology, leading to innovative applications like a university campus tour app. This app combines Location-Based Service (LBS) with AR to guide users to various campus buildings, enhancing navigation with intuitive, real-time visual cues on a mobile device. Developed on Unity and integrating the Mapbox-unity-SDK, it supports both Android and iOS platforms, streamlining user experience by eliminating the need for traditional maps.

## Introduction
We utilize Augmented Reality technology combined with a guide and game approach, allowing users who are unsure of how to navigate to their destination upon entering Fu Jen Catholic University's campus to use this app. As users follow the path outlined by the app, they are offered games that involve collecting items and unlocking achievements related to various buildings, thereby learning about the profound and legendary historical stories behind Fu Jen Catholic University.

## Features
### User Interface

In the interface of the game and tour, the top right corner displays the level and experience bar. In the bottom right corner, there are three buttons arranged from top to bottom with the functionalities of opening/closing the backpack, activating AR mode, and opening the map, respectively. On the bottom left, there are two buttons: the upper button centers the map, placing the user's location in the middle to easily show where they are; the lower button activates the AR tour assistant, which, upon clicking, displays a drop-down menu for users to select their destination.

### MAP

There are two ways for users to select a destination: the first is to directly click on the destination on the map; the second is to choose the destination through the Dropdown. After executing one of these two methods, the app immediately plans the route and provides navigation for the user.
